# FCFS_RoundRobin

This project is a Java-based simulator that demonstrates various CPU scheduling algorithms. The simulator supports the following algorithms:

- **First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS)**
- **Round Robin (RR)**
- **Preemptive Shortest Time Remaining First (STRF)**
- **Preemptive Priority Scheduling**

## Overview

The simulator reads process details from the user (arrival times, burst times, and priorities) and then simulates the scheduling for each algorithm. Each algorithm calculates and prints:
- Finish time for each process
- Waiting time for each process
- Average waiting time
